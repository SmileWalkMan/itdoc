### Go to the browserâ€™s cache/history location, and the cache/history with sensitive information is there.
### The exact location where that information is stored depends on the client operating system and on the browser that has been used. Here are some examples:
# Mozilla Firefox:
Unix/Linux: ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-id>/Cache/

Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<user_name>\Local Settings\ApplicationData\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile-id>\Cache

# Internet Explorer:
C:\Documents and Settings\<user_name>\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files


# Location of the cache/cache2 folder;
# Windows:  
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile>\ 
# Mac:  
~/Library/Caches/Firefox/Profiles/ 
# Linux:  
~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/
